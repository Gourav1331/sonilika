Study Timer Race App
 Overview

The Study Timer Race App is a fun and interactive timer application designed to make studying more engaging.
It turns your study session into a race between the user and three virtual participants. Each participant progresses based on the timer, and when the set study time ends, the user wins if they stay focused till the finish line.

 Features

 Custom Timer — Set your preferred study duration.

 User vs 3 Virtual Participants — Compete against AI-controlled racers.

 Real-Time Progress Display — Watch your progress and others’ positions update as time passes.

 Victory System — The user automatically wins if they complete the full session.

 Optional Sound Alerts — Signals when the timer starts, halfway point, and ends.

 Dark/Light Mode — Comfortable visual themes for long study hours.

 How It Works

The user sets a study duration (e.g., 30 minutes).

The race begins — all four participants (the user and 3 AI racers) start moving.

Each AI participant moves at slightly different random speeds to simulate a real race.

The user’s progress is tied to the countdown timer.

When the timer reaches zero, the user’s racer crosses the finish line, marking a successful study session.
